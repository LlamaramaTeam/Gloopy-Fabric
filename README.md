## Gloopy Concrete Powder
If you apply a [Honey Bottle](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Honey_Bottle) on a [Concrete Powder](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Concrete_Powder) block, it will show particles.  
Congratulations! You now have a gloopy concrete powder block. This block, looks the same  
as its normal counterpart, but it isn't affected by gravity.

*-Oh no! I destroyed something because I made a block gloopy!*  
Worry not, because you can un-gloopify a block just by right-clicking it with a [Shovel](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shovel).

Keep in mind, breaking a gloopy block, will waste your honey and give you a normal block in return.  
You need the [Silk Touch enchantment](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Silk_Touch) in order to get the actual gloopy block.

Enjoy!
